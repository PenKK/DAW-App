# My Personal Project 

## A DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)

***What will the application do?***
- Create music with layers of different sounds
    - Have multiple toggable tracks.
    - Insert notes utilizing MIDI presets to make music.
    - Adjust tempo of the project.
    - Adjust pitch of audio.
    - Cut, copy, paste, and delete audio clips and MIDI notes.
    - Allow for the user to able to load in audio files that they want to use.
- Playback of the project within the program.
- Save and load progress via MIDI files
- All of the above via a graphical user interface
    - View and edit the timeline

***Who will use it?***
- Those looking to make music with either their own audio or some basic sounds the program provides.
- The program can also be used for audio manipulation and does not have to be restricted to music.

***Why is this project of interest to you?***
- I have made games before, but I wanted to make an actual piece of software that serves a specific purpose. 
- Music has always been of great interest to me, I played the trombone throughout all of highschool. 
- Although I honestly have never made music in a DAW before, I have some (very basic) understanding of how these programs work and music. 
- The idea came to from the `SimpleDrawingPlayer` repository, though that program is more of a playground than a DAW. I wanted to make a much more complete and formal version.
- I thought that creating such a program would be a feasible challenge considering Java's built-in support for MIDI handling in the Sound library.
